## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My topic of choice is Movies, I've always had a deep interest on Film and Filmmaking, however I've realized that many people don't give too much importance to what movies can do, they just see it as a form of entertainment. Me, personally, I believe that movies have the power to change the world, or at least, impact people in mass on a level that can ultimately benefit society in general. Nevertheless, many countries around the world don't see the importance of this and don't spend a lot of money to create their own movies, my country included, Peru. But another reason of why some countries don't invest too much in producing movies is because their economic situation doesn't allow them too, and because improving the arts and culture are not on their priority list, these are being left out. My hope with this analytic project is to see if this is true or not, so I can investigate further on this issue and what can be done about to increase movie proudctions on developing/underdeveloped countries, and I can definitely imagine building a user-facing Dashboard with this datase.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

I have chosen to work on a dataset that contains the number of movie productions made per coountry (the dataset includes over 100 countries). The data was collected by Nash Information Services, LLC for the first time in 1997 and it has been updating ever year since then, aditionally the data was collected using digital records that can be found on the internet. The main reason of why I chose this dataset was to find a correlation between the economic situation of the country and the number of movie productions in order to figure out if it's true that more developed countries produce more movies, meaning that these give more importance to the arts and culture than developing and underdeveloped countries.
