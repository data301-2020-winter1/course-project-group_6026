## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I have chosen to work on a dataset that contains the number of movie productions made per coountry (the dataset includes over 100 countries). The data was collected by Nash Information Services, LLC for the first time in 1997 and it has been updating ever year since then, aditionally the data was collected using digital records that can be found on the internet. The main reason of why I chose this dataset was to find a correlation between the economic situation of the country and the number of movie productions in order to figure out if it's true that more developed countries produce more movies, meaning that these give more importance to the arts and culture than developing and underdeveloped countries.
